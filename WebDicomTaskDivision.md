## Analysis of algorithms for block decomposition of images

We thought to take an algorithm for images' decomposition and apply it to a dicom object.
We could extrapolate the image from dicom object, segment it, and return a new dicom object with segmented image.

To reach this scope we thought to use open.cv module in C++, or reimplement an algorithm in C++ or Java. (What's the better?)
