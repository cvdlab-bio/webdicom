# WebDicom - Block Decomposition

- - -
##Problem description:
  - Block Decomposition of images
  - Take Coordinates of blocks of interest
- - -
##Individual Task:
  - We've found an algorithm implemented in Java.
  - I'm going to modify and to readapt the algorithm to our purposes.

##Solution:

Initially, into the implementation found, there were multiple algorithms of decomposition.
We only took the one best suited to our purposes.
Has been inserted, in addition, a small GUI, which makes it simple to use the quadtree.

##Solution:
Readaptation of the algorithm to our purposes, in particular:

  - Readaptation of parameters' values, to take contours of bones and particulars of interest.
  - Extraction of well known format from Dicom images.
- - -
##Solution:
Other possibility:

  - Take adiacent pixels of same color density and put they in the same cell.
